Hello! I am Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao. I am a PhD student at the Heinrich Heine University supervised by [Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang](https://kevintang.org/) and [Dr. Dinah Baer-Henney](https://blogs.phil.hhu.de/dbh13/). I use computational modeling to understand how people process language. Specifically, I focus on modeling productive irregular patterns in Romance languages.

In addition to my research, I teach computational linguistics courses at the Department of English Language and Linguistics. I am also a member of the [Slamlab](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/) research group.

I am actively engaged in language revitalization efforts for indigenous communities in Arunachal Pradesh, India, with a focus on Idu Mishmi and K'man Mishmi languages.

In my previous life, I have worked on building multilingual chatbots and voice assistants at [Skit.ai](https://skit.ai/), as an NLP Researcher at [CivicDataLab](https://civicdatalab.in/) and as a Software Engineer at [Ramco Systems](https://ramco.com).

To know more about my work, you can check my resume [here](resume.pdf).
