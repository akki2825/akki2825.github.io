Most of the folders are three to four letters long, starting with:\n\n\nBinary programs or executable files which are available to all users.\n\nIncludes GNU basic command line utilities essential to the system, such as ls, echo, grep etc. \n\nAlso includes GUI applications\n\n### /boot\n\nFiles essential to the booting of the system, such as:\n\n- Vmlinuz - Linux Kernel\n- System.map - Memory locations for variables or functions\n- Initrd.img - Initial ramdisk, temporary root file system\n- Grub\n- EFI\n\n### /dev\n\nFiles for peripheral and component devices of your system:\n\n- /dev/js0 - First analogue joystick\n- /dev/nvme0 - First NVMe drive\n- /dev/sda - First SATA HDD / SSD\n- /dev/loop0 - First fake mounting point\n- /dev/null - Black Hole\n- /dev/random or /dev/urandom - Random number generator\n- /dev/zero - Zero\n\n### /etc\n\nConfiguration files for all programs. However, user specific configs are stored in /home/user/.config\n\n### /home\n\nUsers Documents, Pictures, Videos, etc.\n\nUser specific config settings are stored in /home/user/.config as well as other . (dot) folders.\n\n### /lib\n\nShared library files and kernel modules.\n\nOftern ends with .so (Shared Object) extension.\n\n- /lib/modules - Kernel modules\n- /lib/x86_64 - Architecture specific\n- /lib32 /lib64 - Architecture specific\n\n### /media\n\nRemovable media, such as CD, DVD, USB Flash drive.\n\n### /mnt\n\nFixed drives, such as SATA Hard drive or Solid State Drives.\n\n### /opt\n\nAdditional applications which are not part of the default system.\n\nThis folder is an alternative to /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local\n\n### /proc\n\nPseudo file system which provides an interface to kernel view of processes (e.g. currently running applications). Referred to by PID (Process ID).\n\n### /root\n\nRoot users home folder, usually empty if there is no root user on the system. This is not the same as /home/root .\n\n### /sbin\n\nBinary programs or executable files which are reserved for access by Root user. Similar to /bin\n\nIncludes basic command line utilities, such as: blkid, iptables, mount, useradd and visudo.\n\nAlso includes some GUI applications, although not as many as /bin\n\n### /srv\n\nContains data which is served by the system, such as Website or FTP server. \n\n/var/www is also a location where website data is stored.\n\n### /sys\n\nSysfs pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel view of hardware devices.\n\nLists more devices than /dev, such as CPU and Firmware.\n\n### /tmp\n\nTemporary files which are deleted on shutdown or reboot.\n\n### /usr\n\nContains programs and libraries installed by the distro:\n\n- /usr/bin - Applications which are available to all users\n- /usr/sbin - Applications which are reserved for access by Root user\n- /usr/games - Specific folder for games\n- /usr/include - C Header files\n- /usr/lib - Library files\n- /usr/local - Folder for anything locally installed by the system administrator. (Not touched by the distro)\n- /usr/share - Manual pages and other documents for applications\n\n\n### /var\n\nVariable data files which may regularly change, such as log files and printer spool\n\n- /var/backups - Backups of key system files\n- /var/cache - Cached data for applications\n- /var/crash - Crash data dumps\n- /var/lib - Dynamic libraries listed by owner application\n- /var/lock - Locked files\n- /var/log - Log data\n- /var/spool - Spool files for cron, Mail and printing\n- /var/tmp - temporary files which need to exist for longer than /tmp allows\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"2016-12-10-linux-file-system.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"journal","title-block-banner":true,"layout":"post","title":"Linux Filesystem","categories":["computer-science","linux"],"author":"Akhilesh","date":"2016-12-10","image":"image.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
