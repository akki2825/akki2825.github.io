That is, the value is zero across many different sets of inputs.\n\n**Capacity of a single neuron**\n\nCapacity essentially means, the complexity of the computation that a neuron can perform.\n\n- It could do binary classification with Sigmoid,\n  which can interpret neuron as estimating p(y=1|x). That is, the probability of input ‘x’ belonging to class 1. (Since, we are using sigmoid activation function the output is bounded b/w 0 and 1). It is also known as logistic regression classifier. If the value is greater than 0.5, predict class 1, otherwise, predict 0.\n\n- The classifier is performing linear classification, so, if we have a problem where we want to classify objects described by input vectors into different classes, if we can draw a hyperplane or a line (in case of 2d) between these two types of objects, then a single artificial neuron could do that for us!\n\n- However, a single neuron cannot model a non-linearly seperable output.\n\nIf the input is transformed in a better representation, we can actually have a linear seperable.\n\nThereby, complicated computations cannot be modelled by single neuron. This is the main reason behind why we go for multilayer neural network.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"2017-02-08-artificial-neuron.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"journal","title-block-banner":true,"layout":"post","title":"Artificial Neuron","categories":["machine-learning"],"author":"Akhilesh","date":"2017-02-08","image":"image.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
