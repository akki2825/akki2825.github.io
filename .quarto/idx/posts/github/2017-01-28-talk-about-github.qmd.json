GitHub is by far the largest code repository out there!\n\nLets take a project folder,( this is what we refer to as repository.) and say we wanted to save it. The save we are going to do is not the normal save, but to take the snapshot of the whole repository as it is. The snapshot here is called commit. \nNot only can we write comments and share this among people, but we can also go back to that snapshot whenever we wish to.\n\nImagine we are making these commits the whole time and we get some crazy idea (maybe, add some feature), we can create something called  branch. A branch is essentially a new development path that we can follow as long as we like without messing up with our master development plan.\n\nSay, I have a typo in one of the commits and my buddy figures it out. He’s generous enough to make the necessary changes by making his own branch (and fix the errors himself) . After he’s all done, he can ask me to pull in his changes by using something called Pull Request. If I accept the request, that branch is merged with the master branch.\n\nGitHub is built to be the place to host the repositories.\nWhen we put our repository on GitHub, we then have a centralised place to distribute the code from .\n\nSay, I have my repo on GitHub,and I pull the code to my local machine and make a few edits, and I’ll commit my edits. Then, I push the code from the local machine to GitHub. Now that my updated code is on GitHub, its easy to invite friends to share the code or distribute something  to the world!\n\nSuppose I have a repo and you are interested in the code but you want to use it for a different purpose. GitHub allows you to fork my repository and make the changes you desire  and it creates an entirely new repo for you to manage on your own. Fork is a part of your github account. You can even raise a pull request from your fork.\nThis is how large open source projects are done.\n\nBesides all this, Github also offers a free static web hosting.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"2017-01-28-talk-about-github.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"journal","title-block-banner":true,"layout":"post","title":"Some talk about Github","categories":["computer-science"],"author":"Akhilesh","date":"2017-01-28","image":"image.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
